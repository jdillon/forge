## Phonetic Considerations

### Easy to Say
- ✅ forge - one syllable
- ✅ kit - one syllable
- ⚠️ dx - "dee-ex" or "dex"?
- ✅ dash - one syllable
- ⚠️ cx - "see-ex" or "cex"?
- ✅ task - one syllable
- ✅ bolt - one syllable

### Easy to Spell
- ✅ All are simple English words or abbreviations
- ⚠️ dx/cx need explanation

## Collision Check

Commands that might conflict:

- `go` - Go language compiler
- `run` - Common in many contexts
- `cmd` - Windows command
- `hub` - GitHub CLI
- `snap` - Snap package manager
- `ops` - Many tools use this
- `dev` - Many tools use this
- `task` - Taskfile, go-task

**Safe names:**
- ✅ forge (some tools but not common commands)
- ✅ kit (rare as command)
- ✅ dx (rare)
- ✅ dash (mostly shells, but different context)
- ✅ cx (rare)
- ✅ bolt (rare)

## User Experience Simulation

### Scenario: Daily Usage

**With "forge":**
```bash
$ forge deploy prod
$ forge status
$ forge tf plan
```
Feel: Professional, craftsmanship

**With "kit":**
```bash
$ kit deploy prod
$ kit status
$ kit tf plan
```
Feel: Lightweight, toolkit

**With "dx":**
```bash
$ dx deploy prod
$ dx status
$ dx tf plan
```
Feel: Modern, dev-focused

## Community/Cultural Fit

### DevOps/SRE Culture
- forge ✅ - Building/crafting fits
- kit ✅ - Tools/utilities fits
- task ✅ - Clear purpose
- dx ⚠️ - More frontend-y

### Enterprise
- forge ✅ - Professional
- kit ✅ - Neutral
- task ✅ - Business-friendly
- dx ⚠️ - Too trendy?
- bolt ⚠️ - Too flashy?

## Naming Convention Extensions

Consider ecosystem naming:

### forge → forge-*
- forge-aws
- forge-terraform
- forge-docker

### kit → kit-*
- kit-aws
- kit-terraform
- kit-docker

### dx → dx-*
- dx-aws
- dx-terraform
- dx-docker

**Winner:** All work reasonably

## Verb Form

Does the name work as a verb?

- "Let me forge that deployment" ⚠️ (awkward)
- "Kit up for deployment" ⚠️ (awkward)
- "I'll dash that deploy" ⚠️ (awkward)

**Assessment:** None work well as verbs, but that's okay.

## Trademark/Domain Check

Quick check (not exhaustive):

- forge.dev - ❓ Check availability
- forgekit.dev - Likely available
- devkit.dev - Likely taken
- dx.dev - Likely taken
- useforge.com - Pattern common

**Note:** Full trademark search needed before wide release.

## Recommendation Ranking

### Top 3

1. **forge** (⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4/5)
   - **Keep current name**
   - Strong metaphor, memorable, professional
   - Only downside: could be shorter
   - If it ain't broke...

2. **kit** (⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4/5)
   - Shorter, clear purpose
   - Professional and approachable
   - Good alternative if you want shorter name

3. **dx** (⭐⭐⭐½ 3.5/5)
   - Very short, modern
   - "Developer Experience" resonance
   - Risk: obscure to some audiences

### Honorable Mentions

4. **dash** - Fun, speedy, but ambiguous
5. **bolt** - Interesting, powerful, but less clear
6. **task** - Clear but generic

## Final Recommendation

### Option A: Keep "forge"

**Rationale:**
- Already established in your projects
- Strong, clear metaphor
- Professional and appropriate
- Migration cost of renaming
- 5 letters is acceptable

**Action:** No change needed

### Option B: Rename to "kit"

**Rationale:**
- Shorter (3 vs 5 letters)
- Still clear and professional
- Fresh start opportunity
- "Toolkit" metaphor works well

**Action:** Rename during redesign

### Option C: Rename to "dx"

**Rationale:**
- Shortest viable option
- Modern/trendy
- Different from both forge/commando
- "Developer experience" angle

**Action:** Rename during redesign

## Decision Framework

Ask yourself:

1. **Do you type the command frequently?**
   - Yes → Shorter is better → "kit" or "dx"
   - No → Length less important → "forge" fine

2. **Who's the audience?**
   - Enterprise/traditional → "forge" or "kit"
   - Startup/modern → "dx" or "kit"
   - Personal/small team → Any works

3. **Is branding important?**
   - Yes → Unique name matters → Consider "forge"
   - No → Simplicity matters → "kit"

4. **Migration cost?**
   - High (many users) → Keep "forge"
   - Low (early stage) → Open to change

## My Recommendation

**Stay with "forge"** because:

1. ✅ It's already working well in your projects
2. ✅ Strong, professional metaphor
3. ✅ Memorable and distinctive
4. ✅ 5 letters is acceptable for the frequency of use
5. ✅ Avoids migration cost and confusion
6. ✅ Better than "commando" (shorter, less aggressive)

**If** you really want shorter, go with **"kit"**:
- Professional
- Clear purpose
- Only 3 letters
- Still evocative

**Avoid** overly abbreviated names (dx, cx) unless you're certain about the audience and brand.

## Conclusion

**Recommendation: Keep "forge"** ✅

It's a good name that serves the purpose well. The redesign is about improving the framework's functionality (CWD-awareness, modules, help), not about the name. Save the bikeshedding and focus on making the tool better.

If you do want to rename, **"kit"** is the best alternative - shorter but still clear and professional.
